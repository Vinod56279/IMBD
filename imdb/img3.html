            <p class="pol">Vada Chennai (transl. North Chennai) is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language crime drama film[3] written and directed by Vetrimaaran in his fourth film as a director. It is the first instalment in a planned trilogy. Produced by A. Subaskaran's Lyca Productions and Dhanush's Wunderbar Films with Vetrimaaran's Grass Root Film Company, it stars Dhanush as Anbu, a skilled carrom player who becomes a reluctant participant in a gang war between two rival gangsters. Along with Dhanush, Andrea Jeremiah, Aishwarya Rajesh, Ameer, Samuthirakani, Daniel Balaji, Kishore and Pawan appear in prominent roles. The film had been in the news since late 2009 with an official announcement only made in November 2011 that the filming would commence by March 2012.[6] After being temporarily shelved, the film re-materialized in May 2015 with a new cast; featuring Dhanush as the lead, making his third collaboration with the director after Polladhavan (2007) and Aadukalam (2011). Principal photography for the film which was commenced in June 2016, was wrapped up in February 2018. The cinematography for the film was done by Velraj, editing handled by G. B. Venkatesh and R. Ramar, and musical score is composed by Santhosh Narayanan.</p>
